          <p><b>Catalyst</b> --- Unravel chemical reactions that occurs on certain types of catalysts could
            be a formidable task since the activity and selectivity of catalyst are highly dependent on many
            factors such as size, shape, structure, oxidation state, pressure, temperature and so on. Basic and
            advanced catalyst characterization could only (sometimes) give partial information about their
            physical properties and catalytic activity. We perform density functional theory (DFT)-based
            calculation to explore possible sequential elementary reaction mechanism that might happen in
            very complex reactions when the reactants interact with catalyst. In addition, the calculation
            method is also being employed to further extract and process information from well-established
            optical techniques such as infrared and Raman spectroscopy, inelastic neutron scattering (INS),
            and x-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) in order to provide a better interpretation and
            deeper understanding of molecular structures of the catalyst and its reactants.

          <p><b>Battery</b> --- For electric cars to be vastly accepted in the market, it would need hundreds
            of accessible charging stations that widely spread out in both urban and rural areas.
            Such high numbers of charging stations would require a lots of energy storage system (ESS),
            a massive stationary battery that holds MW h capacity. Sodium-ion batteries (SIB) have the potential
            to dominate the future market of ESS. Accordingly, we use computer-aided engineering design to assist
            fabrication of E-MoS2/graphene via hydrothermal and/or chemical exfoliation methods. First principles
            calculation is implemented to find the optimum interlayer distance of E-MoS2 that possesses higher
            rate of Na+ ion diffusion and elucidate its underlying mechanism. E-MoS2/graphene is being considered
            to be one of prospective fast anodes for SIB. Moreover, the use of inexpensive spent catalyst waste as
            the raw material will greatly influence the overall production cost.

          <p><b>Thermoelectric</b> --- Thermoelectric (TE) materials are a class of materials that can directly convert
            heat into electricity. The efficient TE materials should be thermally inert while electrically conducting at
            the same time. These requirements provide researchers a challenge in designing TE materials because the electrons
            transporting charges in conventional metals also carry heat. Our group works on the development of high-performance
            TE materials of perovskite-oxide materials, 2D materials, and topological materials. The performance of TE materials
            can be expressed by the TE figure of merit (ZT) that is composed of several materials properties such as the Seebeck
            coefficient, the electronic conductivity, and thermal conductivity. We use various computational tools such as density
            functional theory, tight-binding method, and Boltzmann transport equation to study the electron and phonon transport
            mechanism for improving the TE properties of materials.

          <p><b>Hydrogen Embrittlement</b> --- The presence of hydrogen in steels can cause dangerous embrittlement,
            which can lead to sudden failures, which becomes serious threat to the proper functioning of structural
            components across industries. The fundamental understanding of the root mechanisms by which hydrogen
            embrittles steel is still lacking. Hence, there is a strong scientific interest in understanding and
            controlling the underlying physical mechanisms behind HE. Two of the better-accepted theories are Hydrogen
            Enhanced Decohesion (HEDE) and Hydrogen Enhanced Localized Plasticity (HELP)  would be systematically
            investigated. We used molecular dynamics simulations in order to get understanding of hydrogen interaction
            with dislocation and on how Hydrogen accumulates near grain boundaries. Here, the interaction of hydrogen
            atoms with different kinds of grain boundaries and dislocations in bcc and fcc Fe would be systematically
            investigated.

          <p><b>Hydrogen Storage</b> --- Hydrogen (H2) is one of the most promising candidates for the replacement of current
            fossil-based fuels. H2 has high energy density and emits no carbon dioxide upon combustion.
            In order to advance H2 and fuel cell power technologies in applications such as transportation,
            industrial usage, and as fuel, research on H2 storage is of utmost importance. We have proposed
            2D materials (graphene) as possible candidates for efficient hydrogen storage. In general,
            the hydrogen adsorption (low – high coverage of hydrogen) on the surface of 2D materials
            will be thoroughly investigated based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach combined with
            state-of-the-art molecular simulation techniques. The migration and desorption of hydrogen atom
            on the surface of 2D materials will be also investigated by calculating the minimum energy
            pathways within DFT framework.
