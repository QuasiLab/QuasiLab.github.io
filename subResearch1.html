            <p><b>Fundamental Properties of Materials</b> --- We investigate physical properties of materials to understand their
              fundamental interactions and dynamics. These properties will be useful
              for material characterization, advanced opto-electronics, and energy harvesting.
              We perform calculations using  simple yet analytically tractable models or the
              realistic first-principles methods. We studied dynamics of electrons and crystal
              vibration (phonons) induced by light, magnetic field, temperature gradients and
              so on. From these we can extract rich optical and transport properties of materials.
              Recently, we are interested in the dynamics of electrons caused by twisting of
              their wave functions leading to unconventional transport such as, transverse motion
              without magnetic field. This novel behavior --- dubbed as the electron topology ---
              bridges the manipulations of charge, spin, and helicity degrees of freedom and will
              transforms the current opto-electronics. We published sole theoretical works as well
              as combined theory-experimental efforts.

            <p><b>Hydrogen Storage</b> --- Hydrogen (H2) is one of the most promising candidates for the replacement of current
              fossil-based fuels. H2 has high energy density and emits no carbon dioxide upon combustion.
              In order to advance H2 and fuel cell power technologies in applications such as transportation,
              industrial usage, and as fuel, research on H2 storage is of utmost importance. We have proposed
              2D materials (graphene) as possible candidates for efficient hydrogen storage. In general,
              the hydrogen adsorption (low – high coverage of hydrogen) on the surface of 2D materials
              will be thoroughly investigated based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach combined with
              state-of-the-art molecular simulation techniques. The migration and desorption of hydrogen atom
              on the surface of 2D materials will be also investigated by calculating the minimum energy
              pathways within DFT framework.

            <p><b>Optical Properties</b> --- We investigate the optical properties of low-dimensional materials
              such as graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We are interested in the calculations of the optical
              absorption, in particular the circular dichroism and valley polarization phenomena, and also the
              surface plasmon in low-dimensional materials. Due to the tunability of the Fermi energy of the
              low-dimensional materials, the optical properties can be controlled by the Fermi energy, too,
              which finds applications in the tunable photodetectors or the optical switches. Moreover, we discuss
              the methods to increase the optical absorption, either by doping or by using special geometry that
              enhances the light-matter interaction. We perform the calculations by combining the analytical and
              computational methods, from which the optical properties are obtained. Recently, we are interested
              in the optical control of the degrees of freedom of material, such as electron’s spin, valley-spin
              nd pseudo-spin, which opens up the possibility for electronic devices that consume less energy than
              the conventional ones.
