            <p><b>Fundamental Properties of Materials</b> --- We investigate physical properties of materials to understand their
              fundamental interactions and dynamics. These properties will be useful
              for material characterization, advanced opto-electronics, and energy harvesting.
              We perform calculations using  simple yet analytically tractable models or the
              realistic first-principles methods. We studied dynamics of electrons and crystal
              vibration (phonons) induced by light, magnetic field, temperature gradients and
              so on. From these we can extract rich optical and transport properties of materials.
              Recently, we are interested in the dynamics of electrons caused by twisting of
              their wave functions leading to unconventional transport such as, transverse motion
              without magnetic field. This novel behavior --- dubbed as the electron topology ---
              bridges the manipulations of charge, spin, and helicity degrees of freedom and will
              transforms the current opto-electronics. We published sole theoretical works as well
              as combined theory-experimental efforts.

            <p><b>Hydrogen Storage</b> --- Hydrogen (H2) is one of the most promising candidates for the replacement of current
              fossil-based fuels. H2 has high energy density and emits no carbon dioxide upon combustion.
              In order to advance H2 and fuel cell power technologies in applications such as transportation,
              industrial usage, and as fuel, research on H2 storage is of utmost importance. We have proposed
              2D materials (graphene) as possible candidates for efficient hydrogen storage. In general,
              the hydrogen adsorption (low – high coverage of hydrogen) on the surface of 2D materials
              will be thoroughly investigated based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach combined with
              state-of-the-art molecular simulation techniques. The migration and desorption of hydrogen atom
              on the surface of 2D materials will be also investigated by calculating the minimum energy
              pathways within DFT framework.

            <p><b>Optical Properties</b> --- We investigate the optical properties of low-dimensional materials
              such as graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We are interested in the calculations of the optical
              absorption, in particular the circular dichroism and valley polarization phenomena, and also the
              surface plasmon in low-dimensional materials. Due to the tunability of the Fermi energy of the
              low-dimensional materials, the optical properties can be controlled by the Fermi energy, too,
              which finds applications in the tunable photodetectors or the optical switches. Moreover, we discuss
              the methods to increase the optical absorption, either by doping or by using special geometry that
              enhances the light-matter interaction. We perform the calculations by combining the analytical and
              computational methods, from which the optical properties are obtained. Recently, we are interested
              in the optical control of the degrees of freedom of material, such as electron’s spin, valley-spin
              nd pseudo-spin, which opens up the possibility for electronic devices that consume less energy than
              the conventional ones.

          <p><b>Catalyst</b> --- Unravel chemical reactions that occurs on certain types of catalysts could
            be a formidable task since the activity and selectivity of catalyst are highly dependent on many
            factors such as size, shape, structure, oxidation state, pressure, temperature and so on. Basic and
            advanced catalyst characterization could only (sometimes) give partial information about their
            physical properties and catalytic activity. We perform density functional theory (DFT)-based
            calculation to explore possible sequential elementary reaction mechanism that might happen in
            very complex reactions when the reactants interact with catalyst. In addition, the calculation
            method is also being employed to further extract and process information from well-established
            optical techniques such as infrared and Raman spectroscopy, inelastic neutron scattering (INS),
            and x-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) in order to provide a better interpretation and
            deeper understanding of molecular structures of the catalyst and its reactants.

          <p><b>Battery</b> --- For electric cars to be vastly accepted in the market, it would need hundreds
            of accessible charging stations that widely spread out in both urban and rural areas.
            Such high numbers of charging stations would require a lots of energy storage system (ESS),
            a massive stationary battery that holds MW h capacity. Sodium-ion batteries (SIB) have the potential
            to dominate the future market of ESS. Accordingly, we use computer-aided engineering design to assist
            fabrication of E-MoS2/graphene via hydrothermal and/or chemical exfoliation methods. First principles
            calculation is implemented to find the optimum interlayer distance of E-MoS2 that possesses higher
            rate of Na+ ion diffusion and elucidate its underlying mechanism. E-MoS2/graphene is being considered
            to be one of prospective fast anodes for SIB. Moreover, the use of inexpensive spent catalyst waste as
            the raw material will greatly influence the overall production cost.

          <p><b>Hydrogen Embrittlement</b> --- The presence of hydrogen in steels can cause dangerous embrittlement,
            which can lead to sudden failures, which becomes serious threat to the proper functioning of structural
            components across industries. The fundamental understanding of the root mechanisms by which hydrogen
            embrittles steel is still lacking. Hence, there is a strong scientific interest in understanding and
            controlling the underlying physical mechanisms behind HE. Two of the better-accepted theories are Hydrogen
            Enhanced Decohesion (HEDE) and Hydrogen Enhanced Localized Plasticity (HELP)  would be systematically
            investigated. We used molecular dynamics simulations in order to get understanding of hydrogen interaction
            with dislocation and on how Hydrogen accumulates near grain boundaries. Here, the interaction of hydrogen
            atoms with different kinds of grain boundaries and dislocations in bcc and fcc Fe would be systematically
            investigated.
